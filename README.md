# Distributed Systems
This Distributed Systems class is one big project, made out of three subexercises:
1. [Appointment Scheduler](https://learning-campus.th-rosenheim.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=221794)
2. [exercise02](file:///C:/Users/jtama/Downloads/Praktikum02_RestAPI_V2-1.pdf)
3. exercise03

## Appointment Scheduler

This exercise01 code simulates an appointment scheduler, in which a user can create appointments and save
