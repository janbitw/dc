## Appointment Scheduler

This exercise01 code simulates an appointment scheduler, in which a user can create appointments and save 
them into a directory. 
The technology used is TCP Sockets and Docker. 


### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`START_TIME` The opening time where you start accepting appointments

`END_TIME` The cut off time for appointments

`MAX_CUSTOMERS_PER_HOUR`How many customers can have an appointment in the same hour

`SOCKET_PORT` Adress, to which we connect to receive our input

`SAVE_PATH` The directory where successful and failed appointments will be stored


## ðŸš€ About Me

I feel like I had no clue when writing this project, I still feel like an imposter, but this project is my biggest and most awe inducing project ever... I feel like I'm way more professional now than ever before.

## Acknowledgements
