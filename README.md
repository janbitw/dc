# Distributed Systems
This Distributed Systems class is one big project, made out of three subexercises:
1. [Appointment Scheduler](https://learning-campus.th-rosenheim.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=221794)
2. [Car order service](https://learning-campus.th-rosenheim.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=229266)
3. exercise03

## Appointment Scheduler

This exercise01 code simulates an appointment scheduler, in which a user can create appointments and save 
them into a directory. 
The technology used is TCP Sockets and Docker. 

You can start the program by typing this in your terminal: `docker-compose up -d`
